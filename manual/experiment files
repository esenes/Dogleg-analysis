### data_struct structure in Experiments files

The structure of the files `Exp_<expname>.mat` file is based on the `Data_<date>.mat` but is missing the field *pulse_delay_from_last* at the end of the file (the pulse delay is inherited from a file to another one while merging the data files) and is present a field called *Props* on top which is containing the information on the dates of the files used for building the experiment file.
